# AI-Based Visual Aid App
   Development of AI-Based Visual Aid with Integrated Reading Assistant for the Completely Blind

   Project Report PDF is also available.

# Overview
   AI-Based Visual Aid App is an intelligent mobile application built using React Native, Expo, and OpenAI's APIs.
   It is designed to offer an accessible voice-based and image-based interaction interface powered by artificial intelligence.

# Features
1. Interactive AI Chat
   - Users can record voice queries.
   - Audio input is processed and transcribed using OpenAI's Whisper API.
   - Transcribed text is sent to OpenAI's GPT-4 model for intelligent response generation.
   - AI-generated responses are delivered through voice playback using Expo's Speech module.

2. Image Analysis with AI
   - Users can capture images directly from the app using their device camera.
   - Images are uploaded securely to Imgur for hosting.
   - Uploaded images are analyzed by GPT-4, providing descriptive and helpful responses.

3. Intuitive UI
   - Visually appealing and easy-to-navigate UI built with Expo LinearGradient and Lottie animations.
   - Animated feedback is provided during recording, processing, and AI speech responses.

4. Seamless Onboarding
   - Beautifully designed onboarding screen to introduce users to app functionality (optional, modular component).
